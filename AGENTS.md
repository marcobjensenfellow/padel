# AGENTS Instructions

## Coding Style
- Use Prettier with the configuration from `.prettierrc.json`.
- Run `npm run format` on changed files before committing.
- Use TypeScript eslint rules. Always run `npm run lint` and fix issues before committing.

## Testing
- There are no unit tests. `npm run lint` serves as the required check.

## Commit Messages
- Summarize your change in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add component" or "Fix bug").
